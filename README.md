# Your Repositories link in GitHub.com/GitHub Enterprise global nav

hate opening the flyout thing to go to ur repositories, the code adds it to global nav since it should be there already lol

install [this extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/custom-javascript-for-web/ddbjnfjiigjmcpcpkmhogomapikjbjdk) for chromium based browsers and add the contents of script.js when on GH/GHE and it'll add the link
